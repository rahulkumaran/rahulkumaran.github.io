					Kharagpur Winter Of Code is an Open Source Coding competition which is conducted by IIT Kharagpur's Open Source Society. I was someone who
					had no idea on various things like Git, GitHub, Open Source Coding habits, <strong>NOTHING</strong>. But I guess things were destined to change
					from 1st of December. I had a handful of projects to choose from but I opted to go only for one project as my main aim was to understand how
					exactly one contributes to open source projects. Finally I chose a project related to algorithms. The name of the project that I chose was
					</strong><a href="https://github.com/codeIIEST/Algorithms">"PLAYING WITH ALGORITHMS"</a></strong> which was mentored by
					<a href="https://github.com/prateekiiest">Prateek Chanda</a>. <br/><br/>
					<center><strong><i>I MUST SAY THIS! I HAD AN AMAZING TIME WHILE CONTRIBUTING TO THIS PROJECT</i></strong></center><br/>
					<p align="center">Anyway, now I'll just be sharing the contributions I've made to the project that I've been working on.</p>

						<p>Playing with algorithms as I said was the project I devoted most of my time to! I really had a lot of fun being a part of this project.
						I contributed to <span class="list">Sorting Algorithms(Shellsort and README.md)</span>, <span class="list">Security Algorithms(CaesarCipher)</span>,
						<span class="list">Math Based Algorithms(Catalan Numbers)</span> and also contributed to the <span class="list">Project Euler(problems 20 and 21)</span> 							part of this repository. I was the one who was <span class="list">responsible for creating the Project Euler folder</span> with 2 problems in it.I also was 							the one who <span class="list">created the Graphics Algorithms folder</span> and added 2 different implementations of these algorithms.
						I also assisted Prateek (my mentor for this project) in <span class="list">reviewing a couple of codes</span>.<br/>
						Prateek was a really amazing mentor. I mean it was really easy to communicate with him and he was someone who responded quickly to our queries
						on Gitter. He really reviewed the codes as soon as he could and was very clear in whatever he wanted to communicate. Really glad to have worked
						with him on this project.

						<p>Smvdu-Algos was another proeject I worked on but didn't really contribute much. I made 2 pull requests and both got merged.
						One for <span class="list">Shell Sort</span> and the other was to <span class="list">create a Crypto-Algos folder</span> under which I implemented
						the CeasarCipher Algorithm. I never really got a chance to interact with Sushil who was the mentor of this project so don't really know much about him.

					Overall, I won't deny the fact that I learnt a lot of things which I wouldn't have learnt if I wasn't a part of this competition. I learnt how to use Git, GitHub,
					gained more interest in coding, got more motivation to learn about a lot of libraries which I wouldn't have even got to know otherwise and most importantly, I 						learnt how to style my code properly with comments, indentations and much more which is not only useful in Open Source Contributions but also for general coding
					purposes. Glad to have been a part of this wonderful competition!
