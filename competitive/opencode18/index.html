				<h3> What Is OpenCode18? </h3>
			</center>
			<p> <span>OpenCode18</span> is an online <span>Open Source Competition organised by IIIT, Allahabad</span>. This competition is coducted exactly one month before GSoC. As all open 				source competitions, even OpenCode first tells students and mentors to register and after a while, the projects are listed on the website.</p>

			<p> This particular competition is really <span>memorable for me</span> because one of <span>my projects got listed for this competition and I got selected as a mentor</span>. My 				project Utlyz-CLI that I've been working on, for a while got selected, and obviously, I was extremely thrilled because now, my project was going to get more recognition.
			But I didn't leave it just there. <span>I decided to take part in the competition as a participant too</span> considering the fact that GSoC was nearing and I was still 			considerably new to Open Source. So I thought why not make the most out this oppourtunity!</p>
			<p> In this blog post, I'm basically going to list out my contributions and experience as a participant and mentor. Hope you guys like it! <p>

				<h3> Experience As A Mentor </h3>
				<img src="Images/2.png" width="1000" height="500">
				<b><p class="caption" name="caption"> This is how my project looked before OpenCode18 </p></b>
			</center>
			<p> My project, <span>Utlyz-CLI</span> got selected as a project to contribute to for all those participating in <span>OpenCode18</span>.<p>
			<p> So what is this Utlyz-CLI and what does it do?<br>
			Well, it's basically a <span>command line application</span> that I <span>made using Python</span>. I always felt that it was difficult to navigate through to various tabs in 				the browser and search for what I want like, <span>Facebook updates, searching google or wikipedia, getting news updates</span> and so on and so forth. So I decided to make a 				command line application which gets everything you need from cricket scores to football transfer news, from facebook updates to google search, from news updates to song lyrics 			and what not just on typing a particular command. And <strong><span>BOOM</span></strong>, the result is right in front of you.<p>

			<p> Now coming to my experience as a mentor!</p>

			<p> My project didn't really look as professional as I would have wanted it to look. But after becoming a mentor, I got some <span>magical powers in me</span>. I felt like a 				leader now. I had to guide all those who were interested in contributing to my projects and it was tiresome sometimes. I must say, <span>I had an amazing time mentoring 				people</span> because it really <span>helped me get a deeper knowledge on my project</span>. Sometimes some guys would come up with some doubts, and I was mostly in a position 			to give them satisfactory answers. This <span>gave me more confidence as a developer</span> because I was able to assist people whenever they got stuck. It definitely helped me 				a lot as a developer because <span>I got better at code reading</span> too. Also, I've never been involved in a project such as this where about 5-6 people have contributed 				constantly. Although I don't know these guys personally, I'm really thankful to them for having contributed to my project. It <span>helped me realise how important collaboration 				and team work is</span>. Doing a project is one thing, and making your project public and asking others to contribute is another. This also gave me more confidence because there 				were 2 guys who contributed quite often and their contributions were somewhat major and the <span>best part</span> about this was that <span>they actually understood all the 				existing codes</span>. This made me happy because as a developer, you'd <span>definitely want the entire coding fraternity to understand your code when they see it</span>. So it 				felt really nice. Now we're done with this competition almost and I'm really happy with the outcomes from this.

				<h3> Experience As Participant </h3>
				<img src="Images/7.png" width="1000" height="500">
				<b><p class="caption" name="caption"> Contributions during OpenCode18 </p></b>
			</center>

			<p> As a participant, I've contributed to 4 repositories namely <a href="https://github.com/mrsaicharan1/PyDic">PyDic</a>, 
			<a href="https://github.com/gostudent/Grypto">Grypto</a>, <a href="https://github.com/opencode18/OpenCode-Collaborative">OpenCode Collaborative</a> and 
			<a href="https://github.com/opencode18/HackerSkills">HackerSkills</a>. Overall I have <span>17 PRs merged</span> as you can see from the above image. I'll be talking in detail 			about all my contributions to various repositories and also I'll be telling about my experience as a participant.
			</p>

			<p> My <span>experience as a participant</span> was perhaps the <span>best so far</span>. As a participant I <span>wanted to learn a lot of new things</span> and I'm sure I 				<span>wouldn't have been able to learn</span> those <span>if I would've not participated in OpenCode18</span>. I'd like to give credit the owners of the repositories for the 				same. So far, I've <span>learnt many new things</span> like <span>Google's GoLang, how to use APIs, how to use the JSON Library, how to work with images, how to automate 				processes, how to read documentation of libraries properly</span> and a lot more which I can't explain here because I'll just keep going on and on.
			</p>

			<p>Some <span>contributions that I'm proud of</span> are <span>converting text to speech(PyDic), creating a certificate generation program(HackerSkills), get crypto details for 				4 different cryptos (Grypto)</span>
			</p>

			<p> I'm proud of converting text to speech because I've always only dreamt of it. Never thought it would actually be possible. But when I went deeper into it, I 				understood so much more and I realised I could achieve this. Obviously I did use an external library, but it still wasn't an easy task.<br>I'm proud of creating a certificate 				generation program because here I <span>learnt how important and easy it is to automate such processes</span> and eliminating man power.<br>The main reason why I'm proud of 				getting crypto details for 4 different cryptos is because I <span>decided to contribute to this repo without even knowing what GoLang is</span>. I had no clue about it. So 				<span>over the course of the project</span> I <span>learnt Go Lang</span> and contributed to that particular process. It felt amazing to do that.
